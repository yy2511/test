On a recent sunny day 13,000 chickens roam over Larry Brown's 40 windswept acres in Shiner, Texas. Some rest in the shade of a parked car, others drink water with the cows. This all seems random, but it's by design, part of what the $6.1 billion U.S. egg industry bets will be its next big thing: climate-friendly eggs.

These eggs, which are making their debut now on shelves for as much as $8 a dozen, are still labeled organic and animal-friendly ,but they're also from birds that live on farms using regenerative agriculture-special techniques to cultivate rich soils that can trap greenhouse gases. Such eggs could be marketed as helping to fight climate change.

"I'm excited about our progresses," says Brown, who is adding more cover crops that draw worms and crickets for the chickens to eat. The birds' waste then fertilizes fields. Such improvements" allow our hens to forage for higher-quality natural feed that will be good for the land, the hens, and the eggs that we supply to our customers. "

The egg industry's push is the first major test of whether animal products from regenerative farms can become the next premium offering. In barely more than a decade, organic eggs went from being dismissed as a niche product in natural foods stores to being sold at Walmart. More recently there were similar doubts about probiotics and plant-based meats, but both have exploded into major supermarket categories. If the sustainable-egg roll out is successful, it could open the floodgates for regenerative beef ,broccoli and beyond.

Regenerative products could be a hard sell, because the concept is tough to define quickly,

says Julie Stanton,  associate professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University Brandywine. Such farming also brings minimal, if any, improvement to the food products (though some producers say their eggs have more protein).

The industry is betting that the same consumers paying more for premium attributes such as free-range, non-GMO, and pasture-raised eggs will embrace sustainability. Surveys show that younger generations are more concerned about climate change, and some of the success of plant-based meat can be chalked up to shoppers wanting to signal their desire to protect the environment. Young adults "really care about the planet," says John Brunnquell altering the food chain beyond what I think even they understand what they're doing."

More Americans are opting to work well into retirement, a growing trend that threatens to upend the old workforce model.

One in three Americans who are at least 40 have or plan to have a job in retirement to prepare for a longer life, according to a survey conducted by Harris Poll for TD Ameritrade. Even more surprising is that more than half of "unretirees"—those who plan to work in retirement or went back to work after retiring—said they would be employed in their later years even if they had enough money to settle down, the survey showed.

Financial needs aren't the only culprit for the "unretirement" trend.  Other reasons, according to the study, include personal fulfillment such as staying mentally fit, preventing boredom or avoiding depression.

"The concept of retirement is evolving,"  said Christine Russell,  senior manager of retirement at TD Ameritrade. "It's not just about finances. The value of work is also driving folks to continue working past retirement."

One reason for the change in retirement patterns: Americans are living longer. Older Americans are also the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. workforce, and boomers are expected to live longer than previous generations. The percentage of retirement-age people in the labor force has doubled over the past three decades. About 20% of people 65 and older were in the workforce in February, up from an all-time low of 10% in January 1985, according to money manager United Income.

Because of longer life spans, Americans are also boosting their savings to preserve their nest eggs, the TD Ameritrade study showed, which surveyed 2000 adults between 40 to 79. Six in 10 "unretirees" are increasing their savings in anticipation of a longer life, according to the survey. Among the most popular ways they are doing this, the company said, is by reducing their overall expenses, securing life insurance or maximizing their contributions to retirement accounts.

Unfortunately, many people who are opting to work in retirement are preparing to do so because they are worried about making ends meet in their later years, said Brent Weiss, a co- founder at Baltimore-based financial-planning firm Facet Wealth.  He suggested that preretirees should speak with a financial adviser to set long-term financial goals.



"The most challenging moments in life are getting married,  starting a  family  and ultimately retiring," Facet Wealth cofounder Brent Weiss told USA Today. "It's not just a financial decision, but an emotional one. Many people believe they can't retire."

 

The survey conducted by Harris Poll indicates that __________.

over half of the retirees are physically fit for work

the old workforce is as active as the younger one

one in three Americans enjoy earlier retirement

more Americans are willing to work in retirement

 

 

It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that Americans tend to think that __________.

retirement may cause problems for them

boredom can be relieved after retirement

the mental health of retirees is overlooked

"unretirement" contributes to the economy

 

 

Retirement patterns are changing partly due to __________.

labor shortages

population growth

longer life expectancy

rising living costs

 

 

Many retires are increasing in savings by __________.

investing more in stocks

taking up odd jobs

We have all encountered them, in both our personal and professional lives. Think about the times you felt tricked or frustrated by a membership or subscription that had a seamless sign-up process but was later difficult to cancel something that should be simple and transparent can be complicated, intentionally or unintentionally, in ways that impair consumer choice. These are examples of dark patterns.

First coined in 2010 by user experience expert Harry Brignull, "dark patterns" is a catch- all term for practices that manipulate user interfaces to influence the decision-making ability of users. Brignull identifies 12 types of common dark patterns, ranging from misdirection and hidden costs to roach motel, where a user experience seems easy and intuitive at the start, but turns difficult when the user tries to get out.

In a 2019 study of 53,000 product pages and 11,000 websites, researchers found that about one in 10 employs these design practices. Though widely prevalent, the concept of dark patterns is still not well understood. Business and nonprofit leaders should be aware of dark patterns and try to avoid the gray areas they engender.

Where is the line between ethical, persuasive design and dark patterns? Businesses should engage in conversations with IT, compliance, risk, and legal teams to review their privacy policy, and include in the discussion the customer/user experience designers and coders responsible for the company's user interface, as well as the marketers and advertisers responsible for sign-ups, checkout baskets, pricing, and promotions. Any or all these teams can play a role in creating or avoiding "digital deception".

Lawmakers and regulators are slowly starting to address the ambiguity around dark patterns, most recently at the state level. In March, the California Attorney General announced the approval of additional regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that ensures that consumers will not be confused or misled when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights. The regulations aim to ban dark pattern—this means prohibiting companies



from using confusing language or unnecessary steps such as forcing them to click through multiple screens or listen to reasons why they shouldn't opt out.

As more states consider promulgating additional regulations, there is a need for greater accountability from within the business community. Dark patterns also be addressed on a self- regulatory basis, but only if organizations hold themselves accountable, not just to legal requirements, but also to industry best practices and standard.

 

It can be learned from the first two paragraphs that dark patterns __________.

improve user experiences

leak user information for profit

undermine users' decision-making

remind users of hidden costs

 



The 2019 study on dark patterns is mentioned to show __________.

their major flaws

their complex designs

their severe damage

their strong presence

 



To handle digital deception, businesses should __________.

listen to customer feedback

talk with relevant teams

turn to independent agencies

rely on professional training

 

 

The additional regulations under the CCPA are intended to __________.

guide users through opt-out processes

protect consumers from being tricked

grant companies data privacy rights

restrict access to problematic content



 

 

According to the last paragraph, a key to coping with dark patterns is __________.

new legal requirements

businesses' self -discipline

strict regulatory standards

consumers' safety awareness
